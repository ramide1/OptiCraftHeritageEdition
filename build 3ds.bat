REM Nintendo 3DS build (devkitARM + libctru)
REM
REM This script deliberately calls a NATIVE WINDOWS cmake by full path instead of
REM whatever `cmake` resolves to. devkitPro's installer puts its MSYS2 bin
REM directory on the system PATH ahead of everything else, so a bare `cmake` is
REM the MSYS2 build even from cmd.exe. That one emits POSIX paths (/d/MC/...)
REM into build.ninja, which the repository's native ninja.exe reads as
REM \d\MC\... -- and the build dies inside CMake's compiler check with a
REM misleading "the C compiler is broken" when the compiler is perfectly fine.
REM
REM Same reason DEVKITPRO is dropped below when it holds a POSIX path: the
REM installer exports DEVKITPRO=/opt/devkitpro into the Windows environment too,
REM where it does not resolve.
REM
REM Usage:
REM   build 3ds.bat              configure + build + package bin/3ds/OptiCraft.cia
REM   build 3ds.bat clean        wipe the build directory first
REM   build 3ds.bat data         stage data/ into bin/3ds/sd/opticraft/
REM   build 3ds.bat clean data   wipe, rebuild, then stage
REM
REM The .cia is produced on EVERY build, not behind a keyword: it is the
REM installable form of the same ELF, so a run that stops at the .3dsx is not a
REM finished 3DS build. The CI job packages unconditionally for the same reason.
REM
REM Any argument that is not one of those keywords is forwarded verbatim to the
REM configure step, so build options go through this same entry point instead of
REM tempting you into a bare `cmake --preset` that picks up the MSYS2 cmake:
REM   build 3ds.bat -DMC_LOG_LEVEL=3
REM
REM devkitPro is located automatically at C:\devkitPro. Override it by setting
REM DEVKITPRO before running this script.

REM This walks the raw command line with `for /f` rather than %1 + shift, because

REM only splits on space and tab, so `=` survives.

REM of its contents.

REM cover, so the identity the player reads stays in one place.

REM Runs at top level rather than inside an `if (...)` block: cmd cannot jump
REM *into* a parenthesized block -- the trailing `)` becomes a syntax error --
REM so every failure below exits to the top-level :fail label instead.
