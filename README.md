# OptiCraft Heritage

[![Build](https://github.com/OptiJuegos/OptiCraftHeritageEdition/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/OptiJuegos/OptiCraftHeritageEdition/actions/workflows/build.yml)

OptiCraft Heritage is a heavily modified, clean-room C++ implementation of classic Minecraft-era gameplay designed around portability, low-end hardware, and console-specific optimization.

This repository is not intended to be a line-for-line source translation. The runtime, platform layers, rendering paths, input backends, storage systems, user interface, asset loading, memory policies, and console support have been extensively reworked for the needs of this project.

## Project goals

- Keep the implementation portable across desktop PC, PlayStation 2, Nintendo Wii, and Nintendo 3DS.
- Preserve the intended classic gameplay and visual behavior where practical while allowing platform-specific adaptations.
- Run on constrained hardware through aggressive memory, rendering, chunk, and asset-loading optimizations.
- Keep platform code isolated behind explicit backends instead of scattering host-specific logic through the game code.
- Maintain a debuggable and production-oriented C++17 codebase.

## Clean-room implementation

OptiCraft Heritage is developed as a clean-room implementation. The project code is independently implemented in C/C++ and is heavily modified around its own runtime and platform architecture.

The project does not rely on original proprietary game source code as part of its implementation. Compatibility-oriented behavior may be reproduced from observable behavior, documented formats, protocol behavior, and independently developed interfaces.

This project is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or sponsored by Mojang Studios or Microsoft.

## Supported targets

### PC (Windows, Linux, macOS)

The desktop build uses SDL2, OpenGL, and the shared platform abstraction layer. It is continuously built on Windows (x64, x86, and ARM64, across GCC, Clang, and MSVC toolchains, including a legacy low-end x86 profile and CPU-tuned variants), Linux (x64, x86, ARM64, and ARMv7 with GCC, plus x86_64-v3/Zen-tuned profiles), and macOS (ARM64 and x64 with Clang).

A dedicated 32-bit legacy profile is available for older SSE2-class CPUs and legacy OpenGL hardware.

### PlayStation 2

The PS2 build uses a native platform backend with PS2SDK support, GS-specific rendering, console-aware memory policies, asynchronous asset loading, platform storage, controller input, and optional VU-assisted terrain paths.

The expected USB application directory is:

```text
mass:/OptiCraftHeritage/
```

### Nintendo Wii

The Wii build uses devkitPPC/libogc and a native GX rendering path. The Homebrew Channel layout remains:

```text
apps/OptiCraft/
```

### Nintendo 3DS

The 3DS build uses devkitARM with libctru and citro3d, with console-specific rendering, input, storage, and audio backends. Every build produces the `OptiCraft.3dsx` homebrew executable (with its `.smdh` cover) and an installable `OptiCraft.cia`, packaged straight from the `.elf` through the checked-in manifest `resources/3ds_cia.rsf`.

Runtime assets are read from the SD card instead of RomFS, so data can change without rebuilding or reinstalling the CIA. The expected runtime directory is:

```text
sd:/opticraft/
```

## Source layout

```text
src/
  3ds/          Nintendo 3DS implementation
  client/       Client-side shared code
  external/     Vendored sources compiled into the game (stb_image)
  java/         Java compatibility/runtime helpers
  locale/       Descriptive text helpers
  lwjgl/        LWJGL-style forwarding shims
  mods/         In-game mod loading framework and bundled mods
  net/          Game implementation
  pc/           Desktop-specific implementation
  platform/     Shared platform interfaces and backend selection
  ps2/          PlayStation 2 implementation
  util/         Shared utility code
  wii/          Nintendo Wii implementation

cmake/          Toolchains, source selection, and platform build logic
external/       Third-party dependencies
```

Platform targets deliberately select one implementation for each public backend. This keeps PC, PS2, Wii, and 3DS implementations from accidentally entering the same link target.

## Building

CMake 3.21 or newer is required. Presets are defined in `CMakePresets.json`.

Most dependencies are vendored under `external/`. The one exception is SDL_net, which is gitignored and must be cloned separately before a desktop configure:

```sh
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL_net.git external/SDL_net
git -C external/SDL_net fetch --depth 1 origin b1085eed744eab0c894a5306d822c9241bcf0228
git -C external/SDL_net checkout FETCH_HEAD
```

Game code uses bare includes such as `#include "Minecraft.h"`, resolved against `src/net/minecraft/src`. Console toolchain files add that include path themselves; on desktop, add `-DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS=-I<prefix>/src/net/minecraft/src` to the configure if you hit missing-header errors.

### Desktop (Windows)

```text
cmake --preset gcc-debug
cmake --build --preset gcc-debug
```

For a normal optimized build:

```text
cmake --preset gcc-release
cmake --build --preset gcc-release
```

### Desktop (Linux, macOS)

The `gcc-*` presets are MinGW/Windows-specific. On Linux and macOS use a plain CMake configure, which is also what CI does:

```sh
cmake -B build/release -G Ninja \
  -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
  -DMC_LOG_LEVEL=2 \
  "-DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS=-I$PWD/src/net/minecraft/src"
cmake --build build/release
```

On macOS, add `-DCMAKE_OSX_ARCHITECTURES=<arm64|x86_64>` to select the target architecture.

### 32-bit / legacy PC

The 32-bit desktop builds are driven by the `gcc32-*` presets (MinGW-w64 with `-m32 -msse2 -mfpmath=sse`):

```text
cmake --preset gcc32-release
cmake --build --preset gcc32-release
```

Use `gcc32-debug` for a debug build, and `gcc32-legacy-release` for the low-end profile targeting SSE2-class CPUs and legacy OpenGL hardware (reduced logging, `bin/Release` output layout). The wrappers `build gcc - release32.bat` and `build gcc - release32 - ultralowend.bat` drive the `gcc32-release` and `gcc32-legacy-release` presets respectively, picking a native Windows CMake automatically.

### PlayStation 2

```text
cmake --preset ps2-release
cmake --build --preset ps2-release
```

Use `ps2-debug` for a debug build. Asset staging remains a separate step so large runtime data is not recopied after every link:

```text
cmake --build --preset ps2-release --target ps2-data
```

The maintained wrapper `build ps2.bat` drives the same flow (`build ps2.bat data` stages the assets). The ps2dev toolchain is expected at `./psdevwindows/`; the preset exports `PS2DEV`/`PS2SDK` itself.

### Nintendo Wii

```text
cmake --preset wii-release
cmake --build --preset wii-release
```

Use `wii-debug` for a debug build and `wii-bringup` for the minimal hardware/toolchain bring-up target. The maintained wrapper `build wii.bat game` drives the release build; devkitPPC is found at `C:\devkitPro` or via `DEVKITPRO`.

### Nintendo 3DS

```text
cmake --preset 3ds-release
cmake --build --preset 3ds-release
```

Use `3ds-debug` for a debug build and `3ds-bringup` for the minimal toolchain bring-up smoke test. The maintained wrapper `build 3ds.bat` drives the release build and packages the installable `OptiCraft.cia` with `makerom`. devkitARM is found at `C:\devkitPro` or via `DEVKITPRO`.

## Development notes

OptiCraft Heritage contains substantial platform-specific changes compared with the behavior it reproduces. Examples include custom render backends, legacy UI work, low-memory chunk policies, console input layers, asset streaming, platform storage, audio backends, profiling, and console-specific performance tuning.

When changing shared systems, keep the platform abstraction boundary intact and avoid introducing PC-only assumptions into common code. Likewise, console-specific optimizations should remain behind platform policies or dedicated backends whenever possible.

## Third-party software

Third-party libraries are kept under `external/` and retain their respective licenses and notices. Review those licenses independently before redistributing binaries.
