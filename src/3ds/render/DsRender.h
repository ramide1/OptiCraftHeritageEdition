// DsRender.h -- citro3d primitives behind the 3DS RenderAPI surface.
//
// RenderAPI_CTR_3DS.cpp owns the GL-shaped state the shared game code drives
// (capabilities, blend factors, matrix mode, bound texture name) and pushes it
// here at draw time; this layer owns everything that is genuinely PICA200:
// the render target, the frame lifecycle, the vertex staging arenas, the
// shader program and the GPU state translation.
//
// The split mirrors the Wii backend (RenderAPI_GX_WII.cpp over WiiNative*),
// and exists for the same reason: the platform surface stays pure C++ with no
// console headers in it, so the shared code can be reasoned about without
// knowing anything about the hardware below.
