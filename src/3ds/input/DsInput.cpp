//
// A button means different things with a screen open and with it closed, so
// each one has up to two channels:
//
//   button  menu channel (PLATFORM_TEXT_*)   gameplay channel
//   ------  -------------------------------  --------------------------------
//   A       TYPE      confirm/select         jump      -> DS_KEY_A
//   B       BACK      cancel                 use       -> mouse button 1
//   X       SPACE     GUI/virtual-kbd space  attack    -> mouse button 0
//   Y       CLOSE     exit/back-out          inventory -> DS_KEY_Y
//   L       SPACE     left shoulder          hotbar    -> wheel +1 (left)
//   R       SHIFT     right shoulder         hotbar    -> wheel -1 (right)
//   SELECT  SPACE     (PS2 SELECT/Wii MINUS) sneak     -> DS_KEY_SELECT
//   D-pad   UP/DOWN/LEFT/RIGHT               movement  -> DS_KEY_DPAD_*
//   START   --                               pause     -> KEY_ESCAPE
//   ZL/ZR   --                               unmapped (New-3DS only; phase 2)
//
//   circle pad -> stick axes (analog movement, PLATFORM_DIRECT_ANALOG_MOVEMENT)
//   touch      -> absolute pointer + button 0, in BOTH contexts: the finger
//                 is the pointer, so it keeps clicking screens (see below)
//
// Attack and Use are mouse buttons rather than keys because that is what
// GameSettings binds them to (-100 / -99) and what clickMouse() reads. That
// is also why X is menu-suppressed: button 0 pushed while a screen is open
// becomes a click under the cursor (GuiScreen::handleInput() drains the queue
// unconditionally), whereas the touch tap must keep working there. The two
// sources are ORed together in updateGameplay().
//
// The gameplay channel is dropped while a screen is open, and a button still
// physically held across the menu/gameplay boundary stays dropped until it is
// released. Without that second half the press that confirmed a menu would
// arrive again as a gameplay button the moment the world opened -- exactly
// the bug WiiPadState.cpp documents as "joining a world bounced straight back
// to the title". The PS2 solves the same problem with releaseGameplayKeys().
//
// Coordinates: the top screen (400x240) is the game surface, the bottom
// panel (320x240) is touch. Touch X is scaled into top-screen pixels
// (x * screenW / 320); Y is copied as-is because both screens are 240 tall,
// so the GUI can compare pointer coordinates against 400x240 directly.
