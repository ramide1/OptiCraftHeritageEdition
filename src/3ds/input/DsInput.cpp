//               face-button camera, scaled by deflection at a
//               frame-rate-free rate.
//   menu L/R -> their own DS_KEY_L/DS_KEY_R codes while a screen is up (they
//               cannot be SPACE/SHIFT, which the keyboard and the container
//               navigator already own); the creative screen maps them to
//               its category tabs.
//
//   REBINDING (DsPadKeyCodes.h's contract, made live here): every mappable
//   button -- A, B, X, Y, L, R, SELECT, D-pad -- speaks its DS_KEY_* code.
//   While the Controls screen listens (platformPadRebindExclusive) the
//   buttons arrive as their codes instead of their menu translations, so a
//   capture can land on any of them -- B stays the cancel (PS2 reserves its
//   back button identically) and START the fixed escape. A binding that
//   claims a code re-purposes the button: the claimed L/R/X stops feeding
//   its hardcoded click channel, the claimed D-pad direction stops feeding
//   its fixed role (wheel/chat/F5), and the press fires the bound action
//   alone; unclaimed buttons keep the decided layout untouched (see
//   g_boundPadCodes / updateGameplay's rebind channel).
//   touch      -> menus: absolute pointer + click. Gameplay: LOOK ONLY (panel
//                 drags move the camera; the triggers own the buttons). While
//                 a text field has focus the on-screen keyboard owns the
//                 panel and reads RAW 320x240 coordinates instead.
//
// FACE-BUTTON CAMERA (the OptiCraft-Options toggle, gameplay only): A/B/X/Y
// become a look pad (Y=left A=right X=up B=down) at a frame-rate-free rate,
// attack/use live on the shoulders alone, jump = SELECT tap or double-tap B,
// sneak = hold SELECT, inventory = double-tap Y. The deltas ride the touch
// look pipeline, so the sensitivity slider covers both.
//
// Attack and Use are mouse buttons rather than keys because that is what
// GameSettings binds them to (-100 / -99) and what clickMouse() reads -- and
// L and R are the shoulders as clicks, deliberately swapped from the PC's
// left/right mouse (the player's ask): L funnels into button 1 with B, R into
// button 0 with X (updateGameplay ORs the sources, so any hold order works).
// That is also why they are menu-suppressed: buttons pushed while a screen is
// open become a click under the cursor (GuiScreen::handleInput() drains the
// queue unconditionally), whereas the touch tap must keep working there.
//
// The gameplay channel is dropped while a screen is open, and a button still
// physically held across the menu/gameplay boundary stays dropped until it is
// released. Without that second half the press that confirmed a menu would
// arrive again as a gameplay button the moment the world opened -- exactly
// the bug WiiPadState.cpp documents as "joining a world bounced straight back
// to the title". The PS2 solves the same problem with releaseGameplayKeys().
//
// Coordinates: the top screen (400x240) is the game surface, the bottom
// panel (320x240) is touch. Touch X is scaled into top-screen pixels
// (x * screenW / 320); Y is copied as-is because both screens are 240 tall,
// so the GUI can compare pointer coordinates against 400x240 directly. The
// exception is text entry: while a field has focus the coordinates stay in
// the panel's own 320x240 space (no scaling, no mouse-queue forwarding),
// because the fallback keyboard lays itself out there -- see dsInputPoll().
