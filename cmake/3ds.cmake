# 3ds.cmake — Nintendo 3DS (ARM11 + PICA200) build branch for OptiCraft.
#
# Included from the top of CMakeLists.txt when cmake/3ds_toolchain.cmake is
# active (it sets NINTENDO_3DS), which then return()s so none of the desktop
# SDL2/glad/OpenGL configuration runs. Structured to mirror cmake/wii.cmake,
# the closest existing port (small devkit console, SD storage, devkit toolchain).
#
# Two build shapes are available through presets:
#
#   3ds-release / 3ds-debug
#       Build the full game. This is the normal shipping/development path.
#       Requires the 16 platform backends (RenderAPI_CTR_3DS, SoundManager_3DS,
#       ...) to exist; a missing one is a configure-time FATAL_ERROR, which is
#       the intended guard while the port is being brought up.
#
#   3ds-bringup
#       Builds only the toolchain/hardware smoke test (src/3ds/tools/DsBringup).
#       Proves devkitARM/libctru link and boot without pulling game code.
#
# Output: bin/3ds/OptiCraft.elf + OptiCraft.3dsx (+ OptiCraft.smdh), and an
# SD-card-shaped tree under bin/3ds/sd/ for the runtime data/ folder. Game data
# is read from sd:/opticraft/ at runtime (wired up by Resources_3DS in Phase 1).
# The .cia is NOT a cmake target: `build 3ds.bat` and the CI job both invoke
# makerom directly against resources/3ds_cia.rsf, right after this build, so
# the manifest stays one checked-in file instead of a generated one.

# --- 3DS feature options ------------------------------------------------------
option(3DS_BRINGUP "Build only the 3DS toolchain smoke test instead of the game" OFF)
option(3DS_ENABLE_SOUND "Enable the ndsp sound backend" ON)
option(3DS_ENABLE_NETWORK "Enable TCP multiplayer (no backend yet; OFF keeps the NO_NETWORK stubs)" OFF)
# The New 3DS doubles RAM (124 MB vs 64 MB for apps) and triples the CPU clock;
# Old 3DS is the floor the port must stay playable on, so the CPU gameplay
# profile defaults OFF exactly like the Wii (whose Broadway has a real FPU too --
# the ARM11 has VFPv2 in hardware; see cmake/wii.cmake for why this is the *CPU*
# half of the old combined profile).
option(3DS_CONSOLE_LOW "Opt into the PLATFORM_CONSOLE_LOW weak-CPU gameplay profile" OFF)
# Memory half: bound the resident world to a fixed budget. ON by default --
# with it OFF the port takes desktop preload/unload radii against ~64 MB of
# application heap on an Old 3DS, which is an out-of-memory screen waiting to
# happen. PlatformConfig.h wires PLATFORM_3DS to this in Phase 1; the predefine
# below only exists for the OFF case (same pattern as WII_BOUNDED_WORLD).
option(3DS_BOUNDED_WORLD "Bound the resident world to a fixed memory budget" ON)
# 3dsx.specs already passes --gc-sections to the linker, so this option only
# adds the *granularity* it needs to remove anything smaller than a .o:
# -ffunction-sections/-fdata-sections (what devkitPro's own template passes).
# Default ON for size -- the .3dsx is copied into application RAM, so dead code
# costs memory twice over. Turn OFF only if C++ unwinding (.ARM.exidx) ever
# misbehaves under gc; the link itself stays gc'd either way (specs, not us).
option(3DS_GC_SECTIONS "Compile with -ffunction-sections/-fdata-sections (the linker's --gc-sections comes from 3dsx.specs regardless)" ON)
# Diagnostic: four vertex-coloured corner squares drawn through the live
# pipeline every frame (red top-left, green top-right, blue bottom-left,
# yellow bottom-right in GUI space), so a screenshot names the transform
# actually being applied no matter how garbled the rest of the frame is.
# Enable for a measurement run with:
#     build 3ds.bat game -D3DS_RENDER_PROBE=ON
# (or add the -D to a direct preset configure). OFF ships no probe code.
option(3DS_RENDER_PROBE "Draw the four-corner orientation probe on the game screen every frame" OFF)
# Diagnostic: write every uploaded texture back out as PNG under
# sd:/opticraft/dumps/, reconstructed row by row exactly as the GPU samples
# it (dump row 0 = what texcoord v=0 reads). Comparing a dump against the
# source PNG answers in one look which side of the pipeline an "upside-down
# asset" lives on: the dump itself upside down -> the upload stores it
# flipped; the dump matching the source -> the flip happens at draw time.
# One PNG per texture (animated re-uploads do not rewrite the file); the
# name carries the logical size and the downscale factor.
#     build 3ds.bat -D3DS_DUMP_TEXTURES=ON
option(3DS_DUMP_TEXTURES "Dump every uploaded texture to sd:/opticraft/dumps as PNG" OFF)
# Diagnostic companion to 3DS_DUMP_TEXTURES: write the first mesh drawn with
# each texture to sd:/opticraft/dumps/mesh_tex_<id>.txt -- position, UV and
# vertex colour exactly as the mesh reaches the GPU. Reading a dumped UV
# against the texture dump (and the source PNG) pins an orientation report
# to one side of the pipeline: UVs mapping the top of the screen to v=0 on
# an upright texture name the draw path; inverted UVs name the shared code
# that built the quad.
#     build 3ds.bat -D3DS_DUMP_MESHES=ON
option(3DS_DUMP_MESHES "Dump the first mesh drawn per texture to sd:/opticraft/dumps as text" OFF)
